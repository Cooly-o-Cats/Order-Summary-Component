## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Scss/Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS With Superpowers
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Compiles SCSS

### What I learned

This was my forst ever project to use **SCSS**! It took me a while to get it setup and running, but once that was done, it was SLICK. Overall I really enjoyed this project and look forward to using SCSS in the future.

### Useful resources

- [CoderCoder Gulp/Sass Workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0E1hbcj-NI) - This got me started on the setup process using **Gulp, SASS, and Browsersync**
- [Kevin Powell Sass @use and @forward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0&t=669s) - Cleared my confusion on how to use **@forward** and **@use**
