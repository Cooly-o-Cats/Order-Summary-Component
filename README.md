## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Scss/Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS With Superpowers
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) - Compiles SCSS

### What I learned

This was my forst ever project to use **SCSS**! It took me a while to get it setup and running, but once that was done, it was SLICK. Overall I really enjoyed this project and look forward to using SCSS in the future.

### Useful resources
